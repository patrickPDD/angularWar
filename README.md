code challenge with angularjs

I have most of the logic for a two player game.
    TODO's include
        <ul>
            <li>addPlayer() method 
            <li>refactor for more than two players
            <li>Currently ties add only the last hand in cache - should be three from each deck
            <li>Add a SVG file to display cards doing battle
            <li>Add JAsmine unit tests 
            <li>Style the page 
            <li>Deploy to Heroku
        </ul>
